  <h1>TVOD, Live TV and SVOD: Streaming into the Nordic Market</h1>

  <p>Telenor Comoyo and Iterate have over the last three years partnered on developing internet based streaming services for the Scandinavian countries. Iterate contributed with a team of engineers as well as management consulting on Lean Startup methodology.</p>

<p>Telenor Comoyo’s first streaming product was a transactional video on demand service (TVOD). Customers payed for the right to see a given movie for a limited period of time, and they would choose content from a range of categories, including recent cinema blockbusters as well as locally produced content.</p>

<p>Development work was done in small batches, and a controlled customer base was initially used to tune the customer journey before feedback demonstrated that time had come for allowing a larger audience. The service was opened in June 2011, and later also become subject to a number of marketing campaigns. The service activated more than a 100.000 users, and won the 2012 Award for Design Excellence design price in Norway.</p>

<p>Iterate worked on the frontend part of the product, as well as user experience, integration layers, performance tuning and testing. Integration with 3rd party streaming vendor XStream, offering OTT and TV Everywhere solutions.</p>

<h1>TVNorge Live TV and the 2012 Soccer season</h1>
<p>As a part of it’s Live TV service, Norwegian TV channel TVNorge outsourced its web TV to Comoyo in 2011. As an extended offer to Norwegian soccer fans, Comoyo also streamed live transmissions of soccer league matches both in 2010 and 2011. In the second season, Comoyo and Iterate did a full re-implementation of the technology stack, which had performance requirements posing extra challenges on the engineering teams:</p>

<p>With high peaks in user traffic (“everybody” signing in 5 minutes ahead of a match), the technical vision was “simple and fast no frills”. The engineers designed a lean technology stack that, compared to competing products at the time, yielded an unprecedented uptime and quality of streaming.</p>

<p><em>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone, Silverlight, various DRM technologies.</em></p>

<h1>Comoyo View: Towards a subscription based business model</h1>
<p>With experience from subscription based TV services, Comoyo started developing Comoyo View, a Subscription Video on Demand product (SVOD) in 2012. Offering local and international movies and TV-series (including premium content) on multiple devices (Android, iPad, Xbox), View was an agile approach to the position battle for internet based home entertainment.</p>

<p>Iterate’s “stream team” formed the front-end team, responsible for developing the entire user experience, integrating with backend systems and scaling the product to handle expected user load.</p>

<p>View was run with agile methodology encompassing aggressive user testing and data-driven decision making. “A great user experience” was the pronounced backbone of the product, and daily high speed iterations with live deliveries to production enabled a fast, effective learning cycle for the engineering team.</p>

<p>In collaboration with the stream team at View, Iterate also contributed to a separate analytics product aiming at informing View about needed improvements in user experiences, how to present content and what content to include in the service. Moreover, the analytics work contributed with benchmarking of quality of streaming, market uptake, and campaign effectiveness for BTL marketing.</p>

    <h2>7 Questions to Innovators</h2>
    <a href="http://blog.iterate.no/2013/03/14/7-questions-to-innovators/">Read more</a>

    <p>From the Iterate blog: In collaboration with several clients doing innovation in established enterprises, our  consultants have outlined 7 key questions to innovators:</p>

    <h1>How we work</h1>

    <h3>Continuous Delivery</h3>
	<p>A key focus area for tomorrows leaders of software development, it encompasses techniques such as automated testing, continuous integration and continuous deployment. Main benefit is improved quality of the entire software development cycle, making it easier and faster to get new features and bug fixes into testing environments and delivered to customers.</p>

    <p>The goal of Continuous Delivery is to enable organisations to move from monthly or weekly to daily releases, or even hourly. This can only be achieved when releases are low risk, when the quality of the software is high and when development, test, architecture, release and hosting are working closely together.</p>

    <h3>Feedback from users that lie?</h3>
    <p>A desire to scale is a desire to fail: Most proven consumer market software today started out with a idea that was discarded before all funding was spent.</p>
    <p>Recognizing this is the first step towards a successful innovation process: Initial focus should be to validate our idea, and this way of working is called <em>The Lean Startup</em>.</p>

<p>Asking customers what they want yields false positives. Hence, we sometimes need working software in order to validate ideas. In such cases, the engineering challenge is to design <i>experiments</i>, not products.</p>

<p>The experiment may take the shape of a product, and customers may be unaware of the difference. The engineers, however, are not.</p>

<p>At some point our learning is sufficient to justify product development, and the next big engineering challenge is to <i>switch mindset</i> from rapid experimentation, to rapid product tuning.</p>

<p>Now, finally, focus becomes to scale.</p>
