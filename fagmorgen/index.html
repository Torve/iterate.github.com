             Enterprise testing with Groovy and Spock</h1>

            <p>The benefits of an automated functional testing suite are well documented, less so about how to introduce automated functional tests into a complex enterprise with distributed services and teams. There are also many documented cases of automated testing becoming a burden and not actually providing the value promised.
            </p>

            <p>So how do you go about introducing automated functional testing without falling into the traps?
            </p>

            <p>This miniseminar will describe the process taken at Norwegian Air Shuttle, provide an introduction to the Spock test framework and explain how combined with the language features of Groovy it is possible to write elegant functional tests that both document functionality and provide the valuable feedback required.
            </p>

            <p>Intended audience: Architects, tech leads, developers, testers, everyone that writes code. May also be interesting for project managers and release managers.
            </p>

            <p>Level: Intro/Beginner.
            </p>

            <p>
                Simple breakfast and coffee will be served.

            <b>About the speaker:</b>
            <p>
                Andrew Swift has been writing code for more than a decade, and he is pretty good at it. At the moment Norwegian Airlines is the lucky one to have him in their team.
                He is the happy father of 2, and creates music in a rather eclectic style in his free time.
