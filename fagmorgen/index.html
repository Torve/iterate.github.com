            <H1>Guerilla user research</h1>
            <p>AKA: how to build better software by talking to people.
            </p>
            <p> Intended audience: Everyone who works with making products and services. Product owners, Project leaders, Tech Leads, Product developers, entrepreneurs, innovators and also those who write code.
            </p>
            <p>    In many cases, we create software to solve our own problems: missing functionality in a tool, a tool that we believe doesn't work as well as it should, or the very lack of a tool that does what we need. If we're our own users, things are quite obvious. But what about everyone else? How do we know what our users need? Isn't it best to ask just them?
            </p>
            <p>However scary it sounds like, it's a necessary step to do.   </p>
            <p>
                In this presentation, you will learn why asking your users for what they want isn't always helpful, which do-it-yourself techniques you can use to understand their needs, how to make sense of the data you collect, and how all of this translates into the development of better features. We will discuss how this knowledge can fuel your decisions, delight your users, and influence your way of working in a distributed team of developers.
