                How to introduce Clojure to your organization</h1>

            <p> It seems like a lot of people want to introduce Clojure to their organizations. This can be hard, and the common advice is to sneak it in under the radar. In this talk Erik will show one way of doing it, by implementing a bot which talks over the xmpp protocol. In addition to showing how to make it interact with Teamcity and Jira, Heâ€™ll demonstrate the power of REPL-driven development.
            </p>


            <p><b>Intended audience:</b>
                Functional programming enthusiasts who need some ideas for convincing their teams to work with Clojure. Coders who have the sparkle of interest for Clojure and want to learn a bit more about it.
            </p>

            <p><b>Level:</b> You should probably know basic Clojure syntax and have some experience in functional programming. If not, please join us anyway.
            </p>

            <p>
                Simple breakfast tea and coffee will be served.
            </p>

            <b>About the speaker:</b>
            <p>Erik is a programmer, working mostly in Java and Javascript, enjoys hunting bugs, and wishes more people would see the greatness of Clojure.
